# Object-Tracking-Robot
We have specifically built a ball tracking bot. For this, We have used our bot to track a red color ball through image 
processing done on raspberry pi, what our robot does is it rotates in a 360-degree manner until it finds a red color ball and 
then it moves in the direction of the object and stops in front of it at a certain distance to avoid a collision from the 
object through the use of ultrasonic sensors.

All the specification and requirements for the project are specified in the repository.
